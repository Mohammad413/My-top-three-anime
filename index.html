                Aizawa, a soccer prodigy belonging
                to Japan's underâ€“15 national team. Prior to the series, Kakeru quits his position as a forward

                experience prevented him from playing with his left leg and settles for a managerial position.

                Titans
                first
                appeared 100 years ago, humans found safety behind massive
                walls that stopped the giants in their tracks. But the safety they have had for so long is threatened
                when a colossal Titan smashes through the barriers, causing a flood of the giants into what had been the
                humans' safe zone. During the carnage that follows, soldier Eren Jaeger sees one of the creatures devour
                his mother, which leads him to vow that he will kill every Titan. He enlists some friends who survived
                to help him, and that group is humanity's last hope for avoiding extinction at the hands of the
                monsters.</p>
